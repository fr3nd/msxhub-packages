description: |
  One bullet, one shot, one life… Pick the right target at the right time by following the clues. Scope and shoot.

  In this 100% written in BASIC game from Kirem, your aim is to snipe and kill the baddies. As a trained sniper operative, you get a few clues and just 30 seconds to locate the suspect, aim, exhale calmly, and gently pull the trigger of your long range rifle to make that perfect kill.
