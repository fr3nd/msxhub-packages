  NestorWeb is a web server for MSX computers, with support for CGI scripts. As simple as that.
  
  System requirements are:
  
  * MSX computer running MSX-DOS 2 or [Nextor](https://github.com/Konamiman/Nextor).
  * TCP/IP UNAPI implementation with support for passive TCP connections.
  
  ## Features and limitations
  
  The good:
  
  * Static content: serves files stored in the local filesystem.
    * `GET` and `HEAD` verbs supported.
    * Sends `Last-Modified` header as part of the response and honors the `If-Modified-Since` header if present in the request (provided that the file has a valid last modification date).
    * Sends files as attachments (with a `Content-Disposition: attachment` header) if `?a=1` is added to the request.
    * Requests containing `..` are rejected for security (so that files outside of the base directory aren't accessible)
  * Directory listings: when a directory is requested is sends a list of the contained files .
    * Disabled by default, must be enabled via command line.
    * Sent with a `Cache-Control` header specifying a cache duration of 1 hour.
    * If a request for a directory doesn't end with `/` it sends a `308 Moved Permanently` response to the same location ending with `/`, this is necessary so that relative links to files within the directory render correctly in browsers.
  * Default document: serves the `INDEX.HTM` file if a directory is requested (only if directory listings are disabled).
  * Basic authentication support.
  * Runs CGI scripts following [the CGI 1.1 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875). See the [CGI development guide](CGI.md) for details.
  
  The not-so-good:
  
  * Serves only one client at the same time.
  * No MIME types for static content, `Content-Type` is never sent when serving files.
  * Absolutely no support for text encodings. I have no idea of what will happen when requesting a file with a non-ASCII name.
  * Maximum HTTP request line length supported is 256 bytes, longer request lines will be rejected.
  * Maximum header length supported is 256 bytes, longer headers will be truncated.
  * Basic authentication support... but with one single set of credentials. CGI scripts can handle authentication by themselves, though.
