description: |
  It currently supports PNG files which are stored progressively (most of them), including those with transparency.
  Since no scaling is applied to the output, it works best with images of size 256x212 or smaller.
  Beware that because it first decompresses the PNG fully before showing it, it can be very memory hungry.

  Run PNGView from MSX-DOS 2, specifying the PNG file to show on the command line.

  Usage:
  pngview [options] <image.png>
installdir: '\PNGVIEW'
files:
  - pngview.com: 'http://www.grauw.nl/etc/msx/pngview.com'
