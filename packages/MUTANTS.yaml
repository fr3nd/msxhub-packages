  ## Introduction

  We have been informed of some anomalies in sections G1 and G2 of the Cabo Angosto pipeline facilities. You have been tasked with finding the source of the issue. You will be transported by helicopter to the diving area at 16:35 on next 05/07. Act with caution: the possibility of industrial sabotage is not ruled out.. As you know, this whole matter is of the utmost confidentiality. We trust in your discretion and expertise.

  ## The game

  Mutants From The Deep is designed for a single player, but you can choose between two characters at the start of the game. When the game begins, you will have to dive into the sea and fight your way through with your automatic harpoon. Depending on the creatures or items you destroy, you can find weapons, oxygen, health or coins to use in the shop. Here is a description of these objects:

  ### Weapons

  * Harpoon: normal and fast shot
  * Spread: several projectiles at once
  * Wave: it passes through solid surfaces
  * Bombs: slow but powerful detonation

  ### Items

  Crate: container capsules of the Company. Shoot to open them
  Air: full oxygen recovery
  Heart: little health recovery
  Coin: 1 unit
  Big coin: 5 units

  ### Store

  Increase max air: increases total oxygen capacity
  Increase fire power: increases damage by 25%
  x2 bonus: doubles the game score
  Points: 500 points
  Increase max Health: raises total life capacity
  Increase speed: to move faster

  ## Controls

  You can use the keyboard (cursors + space) or a compatible controller to play Mutants From The Deep. During the game, use the arrow keys or the controller stick to move in the 8 directions. Use the space bar or button 1 on the controller to fire your harpoon, choose options or buy items in the shop. Press F1 on the keyboard or button 2 on the controller to pause the game. Press GRAPH key or Button 2 on the controller to jump to the exit (only in stores).
  Dangers

  Into the sea there are many dangers: lack of oxygen, animals defending themselves, labyrinthine structures, hostile enemies... Avoid at all costs being trapped between reefs and rocks or you will die.
  Tips & tricks

  * In order to dodge enemies, do not shoot. You will move faster.
  * It is better to aim accurately than to shoot wildly.
  * Adjust your resources and decide well what to buy in the store.
  * Explore the terrain and you will get more rewards.
  * With some practice you will be able to go further and further.
  * Choose very well which weapon is the most suitable in each area.
  * Do not allow them to besiege you, kill the enemies asap.
