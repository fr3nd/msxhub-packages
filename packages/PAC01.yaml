  ##  WORLD'S FASTEST DOT EATING GAME

  This game has 3 game modes:
  * 1 Player  -> 10 different rounds
  * 2 Player  -> 1 round, unlimited lifes
  * Fast Game -> 1 round, one life, FAST!

  In the 1 player mode the objective is to catch all 6 ghosts. When all 6 ghosts are captured a new round will start. Game is over when all lives are lost.

  In the 2 player mode the player that scores most points wins. Both players and ghosts will be respawned when dead. Game is over when the maze ends.

  In fast game mode: just survive! Oh... and try to get as many points as possible - catch all 6 ghosts, get the fruit and make streaks as long as possible when eating dots.

  In PAC-01 there are 2 ways of dying:
  * when catched by a ghost
  * when trapped in the green bits

  ### Scoring
  * Eat dots:  when eating dots in a continuing streak, each dot will be worth more points (1 to 7 points).
  * Big dots:  worth 50 points, plus the ability to catch ghosts.
  * Get ghost: 1st ghost 100 points. 2nd ghost 200 points. 3rd ghost 400 points.
  * Get fruit: fruit is worth 500 points

  In the 1 player mode extra lifes are rewarded at each 5000 points.

  ### Controls
  * 1up: plays with the cursor keys or joystick in port 1
  * 2up: plays with joystick in port 2

  For the best possible experience this game should be played on a real MSX machine connected to a CRT monitor. The fastest levels of the Fast Game mode may became unplayable when using an emulator, due to lag.
