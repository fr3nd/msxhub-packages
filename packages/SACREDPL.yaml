description: |
  My Sacred Place is an action strategy RPG
  for MSX in which you have to protect
  your village's garden from the clutches of
  the fearsome Garks. Generally speaking, you
  should arm yourself with as many silver
  daggers as possible and create protective
  barriers using the ginger seedlings. This all
  needs to be done before day time runs out and
  the horde of Garks arrives at nightfall.

  Silver daggers and ginger seedlings can be
  purchased from the witch Aris' shop. Each
  ginger seedling costs 3 Tyzin coins, and each
  silver dagger costs 5 Tyzin coins. If you need
  more coins, you can go to your home dojo to
  train. Blocking eight fireballs in a roll earns you
  Tyzin coins. Furthermore you can ask sage Isao
  for advice. In some cases, he will be able to
  provide you with some money.

  My Sacred Place color palette is optimized
  on MSX2 (or higher) computers, and can be
  played either with a keyboard or a joystick.
