description: |
  Market Master is a spinning plates style game written in MSX Basic and
  compiled using MSXBAS2ROM compiler.

  Inspired on the simplicity of old atari games as well as the five forces business
  model and the BCG Matrix, your main goal in the game is to survive the maximum of
  time you can on the market, fighting and equilibrating all the market forces
  thats act against you.

  The initial strategy and focus you choose to your company will change the forces
  balance, making some of them more difficult to keep in control.

  Also, each fiscal year that you survive will make the market still worse for your
  company ("the universe entropy always increases" would say a physicist).

  Use the diagonal arrows (ex: left+up) and space/trigger to counteract the market
  forces and avoid to be overwhelmed by them. Joysticks use are recommended
  although not required.

  This is a MSX1 compatible game (standard ROM BASIC required). Play it also on a
  MSX2 and you will have a little better experience.

  Good Luck, entrepreneur!
