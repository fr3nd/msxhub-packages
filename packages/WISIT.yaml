  ## The Game

  You (PLAY'R) have to find a 3x3 pattern (FINDIT) in a large game area. Warning you have a time limit !

  You have 3 lives (timer) to find a maximum of right patterns.

  There are 10 levels and 10 rounds per level. At the end of the 10th round, you'll access to the CHALLENGE STAGE.

  Remember : Speed and Observation skills will be essential !

  STORY MODE

  Hounded by Drühl, you have to help Reko to return on his planet by flying through an archipelago composed of 10 islands...

  There are only 9 known islands. Nobody knows where the 10th is !

  To discover it, you will have to progress through the 9 islands in which the difficulty will increase !

  Reko is counting on you !
