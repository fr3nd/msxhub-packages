  ## Introduction
  
  The Menace from Triton is an MSX1 game, in a 48KB ROM cartridge format, built to participate in the MSXDev'20 competition ( https://www.msxdev.org ). The dificulty is tuned for 60Hz machines. If you play in a 50Hz machine, consider as if you are playing an "easy" mode of the game :)
  
  The Menace from Triton is a horizontal shooting game inspired in some of my favorite MSX classic shooters like Salamander or the Nemesis saga, but with elements of a few modern shooter games that I really like (in particular Steredenn and Z-Exemplar, which I recommend you trying!). The game combines arcade-style horizontal shooter action with the resource managing/shop mechanics of Z-Exemplar, and the procedural generation of Steredenn. The first levels start out quite easy, but the game gets harder and harder towards the end. So, make sure you upgrade your ship as much as possible, or it will be impossible to defeat Triton!
  
  ### Story
  
  Year 9918. Humanity had spread across the galaxy, colonizing planet after planet. It was a new golden age! Until something went wrong...

  Scout ship ARGO-1 was on a routine scouting mission near Aigai Nebula, on the edge of human-colonized space. They were not expecting to find anything, however, they came into contact with an unknown object which was reported to look like a "giant head". All communication attempts failed. Shortly after, communication with ARGO-1 was lost.
  
  After the mysterious disappearance, however, the nature of the unknown object quickly became clear. Ithaki Base, the closest military base to the ARGO-1 received an ominous transmission that changed the prospects of space colonization:
  
  "Humans!!! We have been watching you... You have gone too far! No one but the Triton Empire will rule the galaxy! You will be annihilated!"
  
  Humanity was at war!
  
  An offensive against the evil Triton Empire was planned around Ithaki Base before it was too late. Here is where you come into the picture! You will take command of one of the fighter ships sent to counter the Triton Empire, good luck! Humanity's future is in your hands!
  
  ### Game Goal
  
  The ultimate goal is to reach the Triton home world and defeat Triton himself! In order to do this, you will have to conquer planet after planet, getting closer and closer to Triton. However, before that, you will have to find a way to cross Aigai Nebula!
