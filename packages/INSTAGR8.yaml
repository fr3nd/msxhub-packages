description: |
  This is an Instagram Viewer based on INSTAGR8 MSX Basic software that is a
  client to Glufke's server. His server will translate instagram pictures 
  into MSX1 Screen2 or MSX2 Screen 8 compatible images. Those images, along
  with a few characters of the image description are shown on screen. This 
  MSX-DOS client of InstaGR8 server has the advantage of not needing GR8NET,
  working on ObsoNet, Denyonet, SM-X WiFi, GR8NET and any other adapter for
  MSX that is TCP-IP UNAPI Compliant.
  As it doesn't rely on GR8NET specific API, it is not possible to show the
  picture as fast as original Glufke program does. This is because GR8NET
  simply store the whole image in its own buffer and then transfer directly
  to VRAM. Meanwhile, in this program case, it needs to handle all the HTTP
  protocol to receive files, and fill the VRAM as it receives every 512 bytes
  or 1024 bytes, depending on your adapter TCP-IP buffer. If we are talking
  more specifically about Obsonet, then it is well known that it is not
  capable of much more than a couple KB/s transfers, and a Screen 8 picture
  is 53KB large, that means it will take quite a bit to finish a single image
  On SM-X, that has a fully accelerated network stack, it is pretty fast,
  taking a couple of seconds. Now, for MSX1 images, those have 12KB, so
  loading times are faster.
