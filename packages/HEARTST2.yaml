  ## Intro

  Heart Stealer 2 is a remake of a game that
  was originally released in 2013 by Timmy, on
  the ZX Spectrum.

  This game is a remake (or demake, depends
  on how you look at it) of a game called VVVV,
  which was written for the Java4k 2010 compo
  (website no longer exists). By a guy called
  Markus 'Notch' Persson (you might have heard
  of him).

  According to that compo page, "VVVV is a
  4K tribute to Terry Cavanagh's brilliant
  game VVVVVV."


  ## Goal

  Our hero is back again to collect hearts.

  This time, our hero only needs 6 hearts to
  finish the game, but this time they are located
  all over the world.

  Beware of the spikes! These pointy things are
  the only dangerous things in the game.

  To make it easier, you also have infinite
  lives, with checkpoints all over.

  The challenge is not only to complete the
  game, but also try to finish the game quickly.


  ## Controls

  This game can be controlled with a joystick
  (or use the cursor keys and the space bar.)

  Move your character with the joystick (or
  cursor keys).

  Use the fire button (or space key) to "flip".
  Note: You can't flip while in the air.

    During the game, you can HOLD the Escape key
  to reveal a map.


  ## Timmy's Additional Notes

  This version is a bit larger than the
  original 4K version. The screens in this
  version are larger than the original 19x11.

  That means that all the screens in this
  game are completely redesigned, even if I
  tried to retain the original look.

           -----

  The map is compressed in a very strange way
  and it was a way for me to try to use as few
  bytes as possible. A row of (28) wall tiles
  takes 28 bits and a 4-bit identifier, i.e.
  4 bytes in total.

  I've lifted this map directly from the
  Spectrum version because I'm not redoing this
  again xD. So you might find references to SP1,
  which is a Spectrum only sprite library.

           -----

  The game is written in C and assembly language
  using the z88dk compiler, like my other MSXdev
  entries (including the ones in previous years).
  The Spectrum version of HS2 also used z88dk, but
  I still had to rewrite almost everything. :P

           -----

  If the game seems familiar, you might have
  seen a demo of this in Nijmegen back in 2020. :D
