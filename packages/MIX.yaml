description: |
  An MSX1 game that is heavily inspired by Taito's QIX.

  ## Gameplay

  In Mix, you cordon off pieces of the playing field. You may move only on the
  border of the open area, unless you are drawing a new line.

  If the red enemies circling the playing field hit you, you're done for.
  If the big green monster in the middle touches an open line you're still
  drawing, you're done for.
  If the time runs out, you're done for.

  It's fine if the big monster touches you, mind you.

  When enough of the playing field has been cordoned off, the scene is cleared.

  ## Scoring

  You gain points by cordoning off area.

  If you manage to leave one of the Tracers outside, you will gain bonus points
  and the enemy will respawn after a short period.

  If there are multiple enemies in the middle, then separating them with a line
  will:

  1. clear the level as if you had painted 100% of the level
  2. double your the time bonus in that level

  ## Controls

  You can move only on the edge of the open area. When you press FIRE and push
  away from the edge, you will start drawing a new line. You may not loop back
  to the unfinished line.

  Unlike in Qix, the line drawing speed is constant.
