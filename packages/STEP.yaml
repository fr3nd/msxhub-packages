description: |
  A scifi adventure game in three chapters.

  The Earth is going to hell in a handbasket. Rather than trying to fix Earth,
  humans have sent two spaceships to establish a colony on a planet presumed
  dead. The faster, smaller ship with its crew in cryogenic sleep to initiate
  the process of terraforming the planet, and preparing for the arrival of the
  bigger generation ship with humans, plants and some animals.

  You are on the former ship.
