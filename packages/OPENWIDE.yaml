description: |
  The goal of the game is to find and remove bad teeth from your patient's mouth.

  You have several tools available to help you:

  * Pliers - The pliers are used to remove teeth. If you remove the wrong tooth, you will be told if you are near a bad tooth or not with a hot/cold symbol.
  * Mirror - The mirror can be used to reveal 3 "?" teeth. One of these "?" teeth is bad, but you can't be sure which one it is.
  * Pick - The pick will allow you to check if any 2 teeth of your choosing are good or bad.

  Try to remove all of your patient's bad teeth before you run out of turns.
