  As an utility for CP/M, PMARC/PMEXT doesn't allow the use of directories on
  the command line, only drives. To use directories chdir first or use the
  DOS SUBST command to create fake drives to work on with PMARC/PMEXT.

  PMARC.COM
  ---------

  This utility creates LZH-like archives with the extension .PMA. It compresses
  as effectively as the MSDOS utility LHA, but is not completely compatible (you
  can read the directory with LHA, but you can't extract files from
  the archive). Just type PMARC at the prompt to see a list of options.

  PMEXT.COM
  ---------

  This great program unpacks .PMA as well as .LZH archives (even compression
  method -lh5-), and it's very fast compared to other LZH unpackers
  (like LHRD and LHX). Type PMEXT without filenames for more information.
