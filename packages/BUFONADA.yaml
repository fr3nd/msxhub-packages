  # Bufonada


  > The kingdom of Kimeria has fallen into disgrace. A spell of "Perpetual Night" threatens its existence.
  >
  > I, Lisistra, sorceress supreme, must find an ally who can help me undo this mess... but Who?.
  >
  > God help us.

  An adventure full of puzzles and humour, where you play the role of two characters: a useless jester and a half-crazy magic goat, entangled in a mission that is too big for them. Can you save the kingdom?
