  Why another MSX-Assembler ? In the dark past many different assemblers were
  produced for the MSX-system in addition to the already available CP/M
  assemblers. Along with the advantages of these products, there were also a
  lot of disadvantages.
  Some of them had an integrated environment but weren't able of handling large
  sources, others were very powerful but needed a separated editor causing a
  waste of time when testing and debugging. Most of these programs didn't take
  advantage of the new developments in the MSX-scene. Just to name a few of
  them: Turbo R (the R800 instruction set), MemMan, DOS 2.xx (subdirectories).
  There just wasn't an assembler which combined enough advantages to satisfy
  almost everyone.

  Compass is our attempt to create an easy-to-use, menu driven and extensive
  package specifically designed for the MSX-system. The name "Compass" is an
  contraption of the words "COMPjoetania ASSembler". We would like to thank
  everybody who, one way or another, has contributed to the development of
  Compass.

  We hope you enjoy Compass.
