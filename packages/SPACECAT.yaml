  ## The Story

  In the year 3122, humankind has conquered space and has taken their favourite pets
  with them: Cats.

  Did you know that the favourite toys of cats in space are flying saucers? Even better,
  chasing mice while flying around! They are the only ones that can go into the narrow
  spaces and capture the SpaceRats, an evolved species that keeps annoying the
  crew of the spaceships.

  It may not be easy, but cats are provided with expert training on the SpaceCat
  facility. Every kitty deserves a chance to pilot a spaceship.

  Do you have what it takes to drive your Spaceship along the SpaceCat training
  deck?

  Because the world will be a better place with more cats in flying saucers.

  ## The Game Play

  SpaceCat combines gameplay aspects of lander and platform games.You are a new student at the SpaceCat academy. Make it through the training deck,
  and you will be rewarded with an official certificate. With that, you can go into space
  as a SpaceCat pilot.

  The SpaceCat manual is a bit sparse. It is just 6 pages and there are not many
  words on it. After all, cats can’t read.

  Dodge walls, avoid lasers, pilot through narrow passages, catch the floating mice
  and more.

  Prove that you are worthy of being called a SpaceCat.

  ## About SpaceCat

  We published the original SpaceCat game for Android in 2011. Back then it pushed
  what a mobile phone GPU could do. We were always putting as many polygons on
  screen as we could without compromising gameplay.I was already looking into creating a lander for MSX when I got the idea of a port (or
  more precisely, a demake) of SpaceCat, to see how far I could push the MSX.

  This version tries to recreate the original as much as possible, including gameplay,
  levels and art style. Obviously, many things have been left out, but I hope you enjoy
  this demake of SpaceCat.
