description: |
  Run around abandoned places and collect all the rings - but be careful, evil zombie robots are chasing you! Also avoid touching the electric lightning.

  Your shadow is your secret weapon - when in danger, hit fire to switch places!

  40 exciting levels are waiting for you to be mastered.

  ### Additional information:
  Controls:

  * 1 player: keyboard or joystick port 1
  * 2 players: player 1 uses keyboard or joystick port1, player 2 uses joystick port 2

  Switch between shadow and player means also switch of control. New level means the other player starts.

  `ESC` key can be used to restart level when stuck (at the cost of a life)

  At every 1000 points one additional life (to a max of 9)
