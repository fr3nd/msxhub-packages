  This is a MSX HUB client that has a few advantages over the command line
  client version of MSX HUB by fr3nd:
  
  - It has an intuitive user interface, so you do not need to keep calling
    HUB several times (one to list groups, another to list packages in that
    group, another to install)
  
  - It is fully compatible with HUB (but it doesn't use HUB.COM, it is a
    stand-alone application), so, if you install it in the same folder you
    have HUB.COM installed, you are good to go from where you left, no need
    to uninstall or re-install anything :) You can use HUB at any time, all
    information is compatible between both clients, so using HUB2 do not
    require you to abandon HUB
  
  - It won't scroll over lines and lines of text over the screen when you
    request info from a package. It will show the information page by page,
    waiting your input when you want to continue reading (if the information
    spans over more than one screen)
  
  - You don't have to input any command line option, just HUB2.COM
  
  There are a few trade-offs:
  
  - Search functionality of HUB command line client is not implemented
  
  - It supports up to 100 packages locally installed. If you have more than
    100 packages it won't list anything over 100 in the Local Operations menu
  
  - It supports up to 25 groups being listed by MSX HUB. Anything over 25 
    will not be listed (currently MSX HUB has 9 groups available), each group
    name should not be over 16 characters long (currently the longest group
    name is Programming, 11 characters long)
  
  - It supports up to 70 packages in each category, any package over 70 in a
    given group won't be listed
  
  - A MSX2 or better is required
  
  - Hey, it is a brand new program, I've tested it, but HUB has been tested
    way longer than this, so HUB2 might have bugs... Report them at my github
    ( www.github.com/ducasp )
