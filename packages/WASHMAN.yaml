  # Gameplay HISTORY

  The protagonist Chinese laundress must give himself by
  do to clean the garments of the building while
  people protest against broken washing machines.

  Wash Man is a game that will put you to the hardest
  your skills of a real bar room arcade,
  using two elevators which will take you to different floors of the building.

  You are driving a Chinese washerman
  who has to collect dirty clothes
  and then take them into the washing machines.

  To enter the rooms, you should knock one of the doors of the building,
  pressing the cursor key up, or from your joystick in port 1.

  To get on and off the floors of the building you will have to use the two elevators a
  To take an elevator, you should stay with the character
  PLAYER1 above the elevator and to open the elevator doors press the button
  cursor up, or always with your joystick.

  Finally you will have to reach the yellow exit door with the word EXIT ROOM for
  return to the scenery of the building. For each t-shirt and trousers gathered at the top
  on the right of the scoreboard it will count all your collected garments.
  with M = shirt and P = gathered trousers.

  You will also receive a score bonus for each indume-
  nto collected, for each shirt you will accumulate 200 points,
  instead for each collected trousers you will accumulate 100 points.

  Your mission is to collect all clothing and
  and then in the end always go out through the EXIT ROOM door.

  For this version of the WashMan game, there are
  a maximum of 3 apartments, one different from the other
  tro, if you fail to get all the clothes for each
  apartment and passed the 3 apartments, the doors
  will remain blocked, i.e. closed by the tenants of the building
  zo, so if you haven't taken all the clothes on first
  all apartments, you risk getting stuck on
  level of play of the building, therefore it is difficult to
  ste go to the next level.

  The second scenario of the building, with more difficulties,
  it presents precipices that if you fall you will certainly die losing
  a life.

  But don't worry! If you hit a score for each
  50,000 points you will get an extra bonus life and hear a
  good sound effect that signals it to you.

  Unfortunately, the doors do not open on the first attempt, for-
  because tenants are very wary when it happens that
  the door will be closed, the face of a mouse appears
  indicate that the door is closed and also indicates an effect
  sound.

  If on occasion you get stuck during gameplay why
  fail to take one of the two elevators, press F1 to restore
  the elevators to the floor will hold, but this will cost you a lifetime.
