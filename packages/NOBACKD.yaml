  ## Story

  What is your favorite hobby? It’s climbing buildings. This practice is prohibited and dangerous. To escape the police, you are helped by your friend, in a chopper, to take off through the roofs.

  But the locals won't let you climb so easily. They'll close windows on your hands and throw items at you.

  However, falling is not an option. Your mantra is "*No back down !*"

  ## Scoring

  Each climb inscrease your score by the step point.

  Bonus decrease by 100 per second when you are static.

  When you catch the chopper, you finish the level and you are rewarded with the bonus points. If you miss it, no bonus will be awarded.

  Some hearts appear during your climb. They will earn you 5,000 points.

  You can’t exceed a score of 999,999 points.

  Every 200,000 points, a life is awarded.

  ## Collisions

  You fall and loose a life when :
  - You are hit by an item (falling item or clothes) and you don’t have both hands on the same window.
  - You touch an electric spark.
  - The window closes on both your hands.
