  This assembler/linker/library package was made by Microsoft for CP/M. It was later ported to MSX.
  
  Included in the package:
  
  – CREF80.COM: Cross reference facility. Used to generate special listing that can be used for diagnostic.
  – L80.COM: Linking loader. Used to load the relocatable modules compiled with Macro-80 Assembler.
  – LIB80.COM: Library manager. Used to create and modify libraries later linked to compiled programs.
  – M80.COM: Assembler with complete facilities for macro development.
  
  Note that ASCIIC also includes MACRO80
