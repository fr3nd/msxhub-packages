description: |
  MAKE takes a description of file-dependencies as input.
  Normally, a makefile will contain these descriptions but if no makefile is specified,
  MAKE can read from the standard input just as well.A description of a file-dependency
  contains subsequent filenames in the master-slave format:

  MASTER: SLAVE.1 SLAVE.2 â€¦ SLAVE.n operation1 operation2

  MAKE checks whether one of the slaves has been modified by comparing the time & date
  of the slaves against the time & date of the master.
  If the master is older then one of the slaves, the operations will be send to the standard output.

  Besides outputting these make operations, MAKE can also output backup commands.
  When youre using MSX-DOS2, MAKE checks the archive attribute of every file to determine
  if the file has been modified. If the file has been modified,
  the copy command will be send to the standard output.
