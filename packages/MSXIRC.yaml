  the query/private message window)


  ## Configuration file

  This client will connect only to a single server. You can open up to 80 Windows
  (channel, server console, private message), as long as your MSX has enough
  free segments in the memory mapper. For each window a 16KB memory segment is
  allocated. So, the maximum number of Windows opened is limited by how many free
  16KB segments your computer has (i.e.: MSX-DOS2 uses one, UNAPI Memory Mapper
  driver another, a 128KB machine has 4 segments for main ram, 1 segment for
  MSX-DOS2 and 1 segment to the UNAPI driver, leaving 2 free segments).

  To change server and color settings, edit MSXIRC.INI, or, create different .INI
  files for each server you want to use. When executing MSXIRC, if no parameter
  is given, it will try to use MSXIRC.INI file to load configurations, but you
  can use any .INI file you want, i.e.: FREENODE.INI as a file to connect to
  FREENODE, so you execute MSXIRC as follow: MSXIRC FREENODE.INI

  The following items are read from the .INI file:

  - server - the server name / address to connect to
  - port - the port for the server connection
  - srvpass - password for the server
  - nick - your desired nickname
  - altnick - alternative nickname
  - user - the user information reported to the server
  - font - which alternative font file to use
  - ink_c - color for regular text (0-15)
  - paper_c - color for regular background (0-15)
  - aink_c - color for text selected / on cursor(0-15)
  - apaper_c - color for cursor or lower bar highlight (0-15)
  - timestamp - Enable time-stamp on text windows as follow:
      + 0 - Disabled
      + 1 - HH:MM
      + 2 - HH:MM:SS
      + 3 - MM.YY HH:MM
      + 4 - MM.YY HH:MM:SS
      + 5 - DD.MM.YY HH:MM
      + 6 - DD.MM.YY HH:MM:SS
