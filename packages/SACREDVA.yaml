description: |
  My name is Sayri and I am the brother of the king
  The queen and the general have committed high treason
  My king and I have been thrown into the sacred valley
  I feel bruised, nothing serious
  but the king is dead
  It wasn't the blows that opened
  his entrails before precipitating it
  They wanted to be sure he didn't get out alive
  Tradition can no longer be fulfilled
