  ## The Story

  Meet our hero: J-J ! To save the world from the evil Raven, J-J has to make sure the Raven stays in its cage or bad things will happen...

  ## THE CONTROLS

  J-J can be controlled with the cursor keys or a joystick (in port I). J-J can only jump (up / down / left / right), and can throw objects by jumping into them.

  ## HOW TO PLAY

  Each round starts with the Raven in its cage, and a timed lock (counting down from 99 to 0) that keeps the cage shut. A round is completed when the timer is reset to 99 by setting all 12 tile-switches to black. Tiles change color by jumping on them. The player starts with 3 lives; extra lives will be added at 5,000 – 10,000 – 15,000 – 20,000 points

  ## THE CHARACTERS

  J-J will get killed when encountering the various animals on the platforms:

  * Wolfs and rats will wander around, but rats go after J-J more aggressively.
  * Birds and bees will fly straight and turn around at the borders. Bees are faster than birds.

  ## SCORING

  The player can earn points in different ways:

  * 10: switch a tile (green and blue levels)
  * 50: switch a tile to black (green and blue levels)
  * 100: pick up a coin
  * 200: pick up a green diamond
  * 300: pick up a blue diamond
  * 100 + 200 + 400 + 800 + 800 + etc.: throw object on one or more animals

  At the end of each round a bonus is awarded depending on the time left.

  ## STRATEGY

  Each level has another optimal way to play

  ## REMEMBER THIS

  NEVER RELEASE THE RAVEN !
