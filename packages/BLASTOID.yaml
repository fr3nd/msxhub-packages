description: |
  Travelling back into deep geological time in your time machine tank
  you want to bully those spiky skinned echinoderms into oblivion.
  You’ll take them all out, sand dollars, sea urchins, starfish... but for
  some strange reason you really have it in for those blastoids. You’re
  madman enough to say that five fold radial symmetry deserves an
  explosive shell right into their ambulacra. They’re not going to sur-
  vive the Permian extinctions. Come on Psycho, blow them out of
  the water. Wipe them from Planet Earth.

  Blastoid requires an MSX 1 or later or emulator and is a 32Kb ROM
  image.

  Blastoids is a riff on a 1978 arcade game called Blasto from Gremlin
  Graphics. Blasto had its only home port, to the Texas Instruments TI
  -99/4A, in 1981.

  Blastoid was written by Matthew Thredgold in C for MSXdev22. It
  uses the SDCC compiler and MSX SDCC Make Script, and the
  msxbios and msxromcrt0 libraries by Danilo Angelo (adapted from
  mvac7/303bcn and Konamiman respectively) and the SDCC AY-3-
  8910 playFX Library from mvac7/303bcn.
