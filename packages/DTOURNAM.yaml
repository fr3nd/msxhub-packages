description: |
  ## It is 1915, somewhere in the Wild West.

  Once a year, the best players meet to take part in a tournament of a special kind.
  Skills like aiming or shooting faster than his shadow are of no help here. It is all
  about intellect, strategy, endurance and luck. And the ability to drink hard.

  It's about a dice game as brilliant as it is simple. asy to learn, hard to master.

  Put your wits up against over 190 unique opponents in 17 tournaments. Crush the
  competition. Or be crushed. Outclass your fellow players with sovereignty and
  strategy. Or outsmart them.

  I am Dolus Ictis, teacher and trainer, coach and contributor, patron and
  philanthropist. I will accompany you at the tournament and analyze whether you
  have what it takes to become a champion.

  If you don't know the game yet, or want to have the rules explained again, or just
  want to compete against some helpless dummies, I recommend you come to my
  dojo to play a few matches.
