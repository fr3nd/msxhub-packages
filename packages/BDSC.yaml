description: |
  This archive contains the last generation retail distributions of BDS C
  for CP/M-80, and the full corresponding source code.
  The major executable commands in the package are: cc, cc2, and clink.

  BDS C may be used to produce 8080/8085/Z80 embedded systems code (it generates CP/M-resident code by default,
  but the runtime package can be configured easily enough to run in the absence of an operating system.)
