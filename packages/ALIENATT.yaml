description: |
  It is the year 2421.

  Despite the constant threat of exploitation of its own planet, global pandemics and
  wars for resources, humanity has created a confederative system of government that
  has largely ensured political and economic stability over the past 120 years. The
  overpopulation of the Earth continues to be critical.

  Individual planets in the solar system have now been colonized or are being used for
  the extraction of raw materials. The settlement of Mars is well advanced; through the
  development of advanced terraforming technologies, it is already the home planet for
  over ten generations.

  Beyond that, any efforts to reach, let alone colonize, habitable planets outside the
  known solar system have been unsuccessful. The search for intelligent extraterrestrial
  life has also been fruitless so far. Very worrying, however, were the discoveries made
  as early as the 23rd century of several planets in the Vega system that showed traces
  of highly developed civilizations.

  Along with the formation of a confederative world government, Star Fleet Command
  (S.F.C.) was founded. The primary goals of this global institution are the defense of
  Earth and the exploration of outer space. S.F.C. has advanced technologies to support
  its missions.

  The best example is the reconnaissance and combat fighter V.I.P.E.R. (“Very
  Impressive Photon Energized Raider”). Advanced propulsion, sensor and weapon
  systems and the innovative power system S.P.H.E.R.E. ("Super Photon Hadron Electron
  Radial Energy") make this prototype a promising element in the S.F.C. fleet.

  The first and most experienced pilot for V.I.P.E.R. is – you!
