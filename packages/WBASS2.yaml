description: |
  Lightweighted Z80 assembler and monitor in the dutch language.

  A beautiful thing about WB-ASS is, that it used the Memory Mapper for its editor buffer,
  so you could edit files up to 100K!
  The global labels from the first file (which could be saved automagically) were hand-included in the second one.
