description: |
  This is a MSX version for flood-it game. In this game you have to "paint" a 16×16 blocks wall in one color. Use the following keys to choose a color:
  
  - B for Blue
  - C for Cyan
  - G for Green
  - M for Magenta
  - R for Red
  - Y for Yellow
  
  Painting starts from upper left side, replacing all connected colors from this first block. By the way you have only 28 moves to complete this task.
  
  This is a simple game with a simple logic, written in SDCC and using some assembly for hardware access.
