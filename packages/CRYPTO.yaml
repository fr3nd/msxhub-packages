description: |
  Cryptogram is a letter arrangement game where the main goal is to form the right words out of given letters
  randomly arranged into a crossword-style grid as fast as you can and with as few changes as possible.

  There are three word banks (English, Portuguese and Spanish) with 200 entries each.

  Each level adds more words to the grid and the time/change counter is also reset at the level beginning.

  There are on-screen hints of how many letters are correct in the grid and in each row as well.

  Written in MSX Basic from scratch (~450 lines of code) and compiled using MSXBAS2ROM compiler (a),
  this is a MSX1 compatible single player game (standard ROM BASIC required). Joysticks are recommended,
  but not required.

  All songs, except Mozart's K3 theme (b), were randomly composed with the MU-Tech Music Laboratory tool (c)
  and rearranged with Arkos Tracker 2 (d).

  Good Luck!

  Note: ExecROM is not compatible with this 48kb ROM type, so use SofaRUN or ODO (e) to load this
  game from MSX-DOS.
