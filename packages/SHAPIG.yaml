description: |
  Farty Pig is back! And this time he'll have to, uh, jump a lot!
  Our hero was so happy to spend a day at the beach not knowing that the
  holiday would turn into a real nightmare...

  On the beach, in fact, our cute little pig has recklessly cast his rounded
  shadow on a witch (also on vacation) ruining her tan!

  In revenge, the witch stole his shadow and replaced it with that of a
  beast. If our friend fails to have the witch return the shadow he will die!

  Obviously the witch is very angry and ran away to the nearby desert
  astride her broom.

  It is up to us guide Farty in his pursuit. It won't be a walk, because in the
  path chosen by the witch the desert is full of cacti. As if that weren'tenough, the witch periodically releases her lethal bats that will give our
  poor pig a hard time...

  The game levels differ from each other in one or more ways.
  Depending on the levels we will have on the screen from zero to two
  enemies. Each enemy can have its own specific speed so in some levels we
  may have two fast enemies or one slow and one fast or both slow or even
  both fast.

  The scrolling speed (and therefore the cacti speed) can also vary. We
  have three speeds: normal (1 pixel/frame), double (2 pixels/frame) and
  quadruple (4pixels/frame). The first level with speed change is free of
  enemies. The higher the scrolling speed, the greater the minimum
  distance between one cactus and the next one.

  All the elements to be avoided (cacti and their size, flight altitudes of
  the bats) are randomly generated so I am not responsible for the anger
  that your MSX may cause you LoL

  To avoid obstacles you can make use of the Force, which flows powerfully
  within you. Did I say the Force? Um, I meant intestinal gas. Wich flows
  powerfully within you. Farty, in fact, is able to rise from the ground
  thanks to the strength of his farts. Releasing the fire button before
  reaching the maximum jump height will bring in the force of gravity
  allowing you to make lower jumps. Farty can also be controlled in "flight"
  so you can "adjust" the jumps.

  In addition to the normal farts Farty has three eXtraFarts available for
  each level that will allow him to perform a double (or multiple) jump
  simply by pressing the fire button again at the apex of the current jump.

  The eXtraFarts not used during the level will stack up with the ones ofthe next level (up to a maximum of 9 eXtraFarts) as well as being
  counted for an additional bonus points at the end of the level.
  We will gain an extra life every 10000 points (up to 9 lives).

  The game can be paused by pressing the “P” key (fire to continue).
  Controls are chosen when starting to play. Pressing the space bar, cursor
  keys are selected. Otherwise, pressing fire button on joystick (in any
  port) will set your choice.

  On the screen we have all the information we need: at the top are shown
  score and hiscore, at the bottom instead the remaining distance to
  travel, the available lives and the amount of eXtraFarts.

  Now it's your turn, do your best to reach the witch. Step on the gas!!!
