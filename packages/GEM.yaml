  GEM - Gameboy Emulator for MSX

  GEM runs on MSX2 and above, but is optimized for MSX turboR. Written in 100% assembly and employing advanced translation techniques, GEM is able to run Gameboy games at playable speeds.

  The Dynamic Recompiler, a first-timer in 8-bit computing, was first introduced in GEM v0.7 and translates Gameboy code into MSX code at run-time and caches it in MSX memory for further execution. Gfx9000 is required since version v0.9990, while SCC and an external 4MB Memory Mapper are optional, though recommended since v1.0.
