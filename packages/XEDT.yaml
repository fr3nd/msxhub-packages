  MSX SOUND EDITOR [XEDT]

  This sound editor uses MML data input. You can create sounds and play songs by operating each sound source of
  PSG + OPLL + PCM.

  You can operate two MSX OPLL and PSG to achieve stereo sound.
  An editor that creates data for the ADX driver.
  The other is that you can also use the PCM sound source of MSX Turbo R.

  Sample data is also included for reference.

  MSX-DOS1 or MSX-DOS2 is required.

  Compatible models:
  MSX2, MSX2+, MSX-TR

  There are two different programs:

  * XEDTM: for MSX2 and higher. No PCM samples nor memory mapper allowed.
  * XEDTR: for MSX turbo R only. PCM samples and memory mapper allowed.

  Both versions are compatible with MSX-DOS and MSX-DOS2 and are provided with some music files and a couple of tools, a .DIX file generator (playlist file) and a WAV to PCM converter.

  A previous release of this tool was already released as [XEDTF](https://msxhub.com/XEDTF).
