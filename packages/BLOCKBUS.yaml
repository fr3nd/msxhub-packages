description: |
  This is the MSX version of Blockbuster. In this game you have to combine blocks with the same color in groups of 3 or more. Control the blocks in the middle columns with either cursor keys or joystick: up/down to move the blocks up or down, left/right to swap the blocks and fire to move them to the left and right columns.
  Try to set the highest score. There are 4 levels, after clearing a number of blocks the level will go up. Every level up will speed up the timer.

  Score:

  * Combine 3 blocks : 1 point
  * Combine 4 blocks : 20 points
  * 1 column empty: 5 points
  * Both columns empty: 15 points
