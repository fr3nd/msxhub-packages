description: |
  The tenants in the houses of the city are angry and then go on strike
  at work, and therefore in protest they throw the garbage out of their windows
  on the streets at night. Passers-by also protest,
  and yet they ask for help from an urban hygiene company by calling
  a particular garbage man.

  Here you are the protagonist of the famous broom; "PIPPO LA SCOPA FICCANASO".

  Your task is to clean the road well, which is continually dirty
  by the inhabitants of the city, again as a protest to the tenants,
  they will not give you respite, because to put you in danger, they will send you
  vacuum cleaners to attack you and dirty even more
  the street.
