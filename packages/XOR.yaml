  XOR 2021 is a remake of XOR, a game
  originally released in 1987 for the ZX Spectrum,
  BBC, and some other 8-bit computers.

  15 Levels in total, XOR is first marketed as
  an educational game. But it is really a maze
  game, with some similarities to Boulderdash,
  and also with turn based movement, and have
  puzzles that are quite difficult. For me,
  this is a brilliant puzzle game.

  ## Goal

  1 Letter is hidden behind each door of the 15
  levels. Collect all the 15 letters (and perhaps
  some extra clues) to find the hidden word, an
  anagram.

  Note that you cannot enter the door until you
  have collected all the masks in the level.

  In these 15 levels, you will encounter 2 kinds
  of forcefields, walking chickens, exploding
  bombs, dolls, BMUS (Beam Me Up Scotty), and many
  other items that behave as you'd expected, or not.
  It's up to you to find out what they do. =)

  The levels get harder the further you progress,
  and the later levels can be really hard!

  Note 2: The solution to this version differs
  from the original version, and is a word consisting
  of 15 letters.
