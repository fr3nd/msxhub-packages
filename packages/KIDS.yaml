description: |
  AKID and KID are editors released with the MSX-DOS2 tools by ASCII.
  
  Differences between them (extracted from [Relearning MSX](https://www.lavandeira.net/2015/01/relearning-msx-10-the-kid-akid-text-editor-part-1/):
  
  * KID supports editing text in Japanese, AKID supports only western characters
  * KID can edit up to around 60 KB in size, AKID up to 110 KB
  * All operations are generally faster in AKID, because KID runs in a graphics mode and has to move around more data
  * AKID doesn't support Japanese characters in file names
  * AKID's menus an status messages are all in English, KID’s are all in Japanese
