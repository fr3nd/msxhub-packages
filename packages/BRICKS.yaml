description: |
  This game is set in the backyard of Joe and Sam, where they play ball. Just hanging out, having fun, their quality time together suddenly gets interrupted by falling debris caused by a nearby construction side. Goes again to show, that builders should always be careful where they put their tools and equipment. When they get sloppy, bricks start falling off scaffolds with big trouble as a result. Luckily, Joe is a young, agile sport who doesnâ€™t mind jumping a bit to avoid such terrible accidents to happen. Reach the friendly cat friend Sam to save him from horror.
