  # micro ROCKETz for MSX COMPUTER EMULATORS

  The old school mini game for 1 human player.

  ## Plot:

  ZILOXX: Massive. Alien enemies. Invading for sport. Parallel universes.
  Bending. Space-time continuum. Overlapping themselves. One dimension. One world.
  One invader. Attacking. Shooting. Firing > Huge energy matrix blocks. From the
  stars. Down.

  YOU: A cyborg. Female. SVETLN_A7. Only micro rocketz. Big block of highly
  concentrated afterburner energy. Stop the ZILOXX. Fight! Friends are coming.
  Air support. Reinforcements. Resist.

  ## Rules and purpose of the game:

  > Fight against 9 ZILOXX enemies.
  > How many times in a row can you intercept the HUGE energy matrix blocks?
  > Use only your [SPACE] key or the [FIRE] button while playing.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------

  ## How to run the program:

  1) Open the MSX emulator (in this case we will use the blueMSX emulator).
  2) Insert the virtual diskette 'micro_rocketz_MSXdev22' into the virtual MSX 1
     computer (drive A).
  3) Start the MSX emulation if necessary.

  ----------------------------------------

  ## Important notes:

  * Write down your final scores (on paper, for example).
  * You can run the disk on your REAL MSX COMPUTER too.
  * If you have a REAL MSX COMPUTER with cassette cables, you can load any of the
    WAV files stored in the 'EXTRA_cassette_tape_WAVs' folder. Connect the white
    jack to a music device (like a cell phone). It's old school time. Run any game
    with RUN"CAS:" + [RETURN]. Play the WAV file at high volume.
