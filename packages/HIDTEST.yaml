  This utility lets you test a lot of Human Interface Devices that can be
  connected to the MSX, either directly or by using adapters. It was formerly
  known as *JOYTEST*, but it got renamed since now supports a lot more devices
  than just joysticks and joypads.

  ## List of fully supported devices that are automatically detected:

  1. Native MSX devices
     - Joystick (default)
     - Mouse

  6. The following devices are incompatible with the MSX-HID detection, but you can hold a button to disable the detection and force a compatibility mode:
     - Hold the button-B:
       - Panasonic FS-JH1 joywheel
       - Panasonic FS-JS222 joypad

  Warning: **Never** connect any Megadrive device directly to the MSX as it can
  damage your computer and/or the device! Always connect them using a joymega
  adapter. You can buy one in the MSX community, or DIY following the
