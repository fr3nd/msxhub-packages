  This utility lets you test a lot of Human Interface Devices that can be
  connected to the MSX, either directly or by using adapters. It was formerly
  known as *JOYTEST*, but it got renamed since now supports a lot more devices
  than just joysticks and joypads.

  ## List of fully supported devices that are automatically detected:

  1. Native MSX devices
     - Joystick (default)
     - Mouse
     - Trackball
     - Touchpad
     - Keyboard (directional keys, SPACE and GRAPH)
     - Light gun (Plus-X Terminator Laser protocol)
     - Light Pen (note: Only the Sanyo interface was tested. The MSX2-BIOS V9938 light pen support is implemented but still require testing)
     - Micomsoft XE-1AP analog joypad
       - Micomsoft XE-1AJ analog joypad (has the same protocol as the XE-1AP)
       - Sharp Cyberstick CZ-8NJ2 (has the same protocol as the XE-1AP)
     - PWM protocol devices
       - MSX-Paddle
       - Yamaha MMP-01
     - Vaus Arkanoid paddle

  2. Joymega adapter devices
     - Sega Megadrive 3-button joypad
     - Sega Megadrive 6-button joypad
     - Sega Megadrive MK-1654 Multi-tap (and compatibles)

  3. Joysat adapter devices
     - Sega Saturn digital joypad
     - Sega Saturn analog joystick

  4. PWM devices via adapters
     - IBM DA-15 joysticks
     - Atari 2600's dual-paddles

  Warning: **Never** connect any Megadrive device directly to the MSX as it can
  damage your computer and/or the device! Always connect them using a joymega
  adapter. You can buy one in the MSX community, or DIY following the
  instructions shown here:
  http://frs.badcoffee.info/hardware/joymega-en.html

  ## Devices that are detected, but have no drivers:
  - Sega Saturn mouse

  ## Only planned
  - Panasonic FS-JH1 joywheel (there's no doc available about its protocol yet)
