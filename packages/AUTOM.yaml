  # AUTOMANIA (MANIC MECHANIC)

  ## Welcome to the world of Wally Week.

  O.K. Wally try and get it right this time!
  All you have to do is get these car
  parts from the store, take them to the
  assambly area and put them together.

  Simple, INNIT? If you bought decent
  shelving units things wouldn't keep
  falling off would they Wally, and if the
  gangplanks seem to have a mind of
  their own happen it's because you're a
  Wally, Wally. If you put things back in
  their right places you wouldn't have to
  jump over them to get what you want.
  With your fiat hat, beer belly and
  oversize boots you really are a Wally,
  Wally.

  You as Wally Week have ten cars to
  build, each consisting of 6 parts. You
  will begin in the store area with tyres
  bouncing around to hit you. You must
  go to the stock room, identify the parts
  required, and go up the ladders to
  each level to collect them (moving
  over the part will collect it). The
  gangplanks are none too safe and you
  must jump the gaps to reach the
  relevant parts. There are various items
  strewn on the floors. These appear in
  different places on each screen, so the
  game is a constant challenge.

  You will then return to the assembly
  area to place the parts in their correct
  position on the car, but to deposit the
  upper parts of the car (e.g.
  windscreen, roof, etc.) you will have to
  jump when in the correct position.

  On menu screen you will see:

  * Key 1 ­ Music On
  * Key 2 ­ Music Off
  * Key 3 ­ Joystick (to play for)
  * Key 4 ­ Cursors (to play for)
  * Key 5 ­ Credits (to show this crazy crew)

  You will start with 3 lives and gain an
  extra live for each car you complete.
  However, you also have time limit on
  each car part and will lose a life if you
  exceed this limit.

  Right Wally, away you go!!

  Watch out for Wally Weeks other
  wacky adventures.
