  # WÖRD!

  A game for MSX similar to Wordle. WÖRD is not a real Swedish word and
  should be read as “Word”.

  ## Languages

  The game can be played in English, Spanish, Dutch and Swedish by selecting
  one of the four the ROM files. Spanish version adds the letter Ñ and Swedish
  adds Å Ä Ö. No other diacritical marks are supported so words must be written
  without them. E.g. È becomes E.

  ## Gameplay

  Guess the five letter word in six tries. Each guess must be five letters but doesn’t
  have to be a real word. After each guess, the color of the frame will indicate
  how close your guess was.

  * Yellow: Letter is in the word but in wrong possition.
  * Green: Letter is correct.
  * White: Letter is not in the word. These letter will also be marked with blue on the virtual keyboard.

  ## Controls

  Letters can be typed on a keyboard and the guess is submitted with Enter. A
  joystick can also be used to move the cursor on the virtual keyboard. After six
  guesses press space/fire to see the correct answer on the last line. ESC can be
  used to give up and start over.

  ## Warning

  The game may contain inappropriate or offensive words that is not sutable for
